    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These delicate cookies are shockingly easy to make considering how hard this 
        recipe was for me to crack! Also known as French butter cakes, madeleines are well-known, 
        easily-recognizable, sophisticated little cakes. They have a reputation for being fussy, 
        and what they’re really known for is their scalloped shell-shape and their characteristic bump.

        Steps (Instructions)
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375F (190C) and whisk together 1 Tablespoon melted butter and 1 ½ teaspoons flour. 
            Use a pastry brush to lightly but thoroughly grease every cavity of your madeleine pan. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small heatproof bowl, melt remaining 10 Tablespoons of butter. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugars, vanilla extract, and salt. 
            Whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined (about 30 seconds).
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift flour into the egg mixture, about ⅓ of the flour at a time, 
            gently stirring into egg mixture after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle cooled melted butter around the edge of the batter and add zest, if using. 
            Gently fold into batter using a spatula until ingredients are thoroughly combined 
            (but do not over-mix).
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop batter by heaping Tablespoon into prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer to center rack of 375F (190C) preheated oven and bake for 9 minutes or madeleines are 
            light golden brown and spring back when lightly touched. 
            Remove to a cooling rack to cool immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your madeleine pan did not hold all of the batter, allow the pan to cool before 
            re-brushing with butter/flour mixture and refilling with batter and baking your next batch.
        </li>
        <li>
            If desired, sprinkle madeleines with additional powdered sugar or dip in melted chocolate before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
